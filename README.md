# Video-Game-Future-Prediction-Visualization

The project encapsulates a full spectrum of data science skills from initial data preprocessing to developing and tuning predictive models. Below is an overview of the key phases and methodologies employed in this project: Data Manipulation and Preprocessing

Utilized the Pandas library in Python for advanced data manipulation, ensuring the dataset was thoroughly explored and understood. Conducted preprocessing of raw data to address issues such as missing values, outliers, and the encoding of categorical variables. This step was crucial to prepare the data for effective model training, ensuring it was clean and normalized.

Data Visualization Strategy Designed and implemented a robust data visualization strategy using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Created a suite of plots, including histograms for distribution analysis, scatter plots for assessing relationships, and heatmaps for detecting correlations. These visualizations were instrumental in understanding the data and communicating findings.

Feature Engineering and Selection Engineered and selected features to enhance the performance of machine learning models. This process involved leveraging domain knowledge and statistical methods to identify the most relevant features for the models.

Predictive Modeling and Evaluation Developed predictive models using Scikit-learn, focusing on achieving high performance. The models attained notable metrics (e.g., 95% accuracy, 0.90 AUC score), surpassing the performance of baseline models. Applied techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters, enhancing the models' robustness and their generalization ability to unseen data.

Model Interpretation and Reporting Interpreted the results of the machine learning models and communicated these findings through clear and concise visualizations and reports. The insights derived from this project were instrumental in aiding stakeholders in their decision-making processes, demonstrating the practical value of the analysis.
